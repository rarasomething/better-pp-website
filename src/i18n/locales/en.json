  "unit1_lesson2_title": "2. Definition of coding and programming",
  "unit1_lesson2_info": "3-5 min read · 3 questions",
  "unit1_lesson2_paragraph1": "What happens behind the scenes of anything digital — websites, apps, video games, and so much more? It’s all thanks to something called programming. In this lesson, you’ll learn about two recurring key terms of this station: programming and coding.",
  "unit1_lesson2_paragraph2": "First, let’s see how much you already know.",
  "unit1_lesson2_paragraph3": "It’s a common misconception that programming and coding are the same thing. They might sound similar, but they mean different things. Before we dive into the details, consider the difference between construction workers and architects.",
  "unit1_lesson2_paragraph4": "Construction workers follow a given blueprint and place the materials accordingly so that the house forms correctly. They don’t need to know if the design looks good.",
  "unit1_lesson2_paragraph5": "Architects design the blueprint according to a client's requests. They ensure the plumbing, electricity, and design all work together, and oversee the construction. If something goes wrong (such as incorrect materials being used), they may intervene directly and fix it.",
  "unit1_lesson2_paragraph6": "Now, think of the construction worker as a coder and the architect as a programmer.",
  "unit1_lesson2_paragraph7": "A coder writes code according to a thought-out solution to the problem, and their primary goal is to get the computer to perform specific tasks. For example, if the goal is to write code that finds the sum of two numbers, they tell the computer to add the two numbers, following conventions that the computer understands.",
  "unit1_lesson2_paragraph8": "A programmer, however, has a much bigger responsibility. They not only code but also process problems, design and plan solutions, test them, and fix any errors that occur. Programming is more about problem-solving and ensuring overall functionality rather than translating existing solutions into code. For example, a programmer would design the logic for a calculator application, write the code, test it, and improve its performance.",
  "unit1_lesson2_paragraph9": "In summary, you can think of coding as one instruction in the long recipe called programming. In the following lessons, you’re going to learn about the specifics of each term.",
  "unit1_lesson2_question1": "QUESTION (T/F): Programming and coding have the same meaning.",
  "unit1_lesson2_question1_option1": "True",
  "unit1_lesson2_question1_option2": "False",
  "unit1_lesson2_question1_answer": "Great job!",
  "unit1_lesson2_question1_wrong_answer": "The correct answer is false, but don’t worry. By the end of this lesson, you’ll easily be able to tell programming and coding apart.",
  "unit1_lesson2_question2": "QUESTION (A/B): Make a guess — Who do you think is the construction worker and who do you think is the architect?",
  "unit1_lesson2_question2_option1": "A. The construction workers are the coders and the architects are the programmers.",
  "unit1_lesson2_question2_option2": "B. The construction workers are the programmers and the architects are the coders.",
  "unit1_lesson2_question2_answer": "Good!",
  "unit1_lesson2_question2_wrong_answer": "Nice try! The correct answer is A. The construction workers are the coders and the architects are the programmers. Keep reading to find out why!",
  "unit1_lesson2_question3": "QUESTION (A/B): Select the correct statement.",
  "unit1_lesson2_question3_option1": "A. Programming is a part of coding.",

  "unit1_lesson2_question3_answer": "Awesome!",
  "unit1_lesson2_question3_wrong_answer": "So close! The correct answer is B. Coding is a part of programming. Coding is a step in the process of programming, just like how writing the plot is a step in the process of publishing a book.",

  "unit1_lesson3_title": "3. Coding as Part of Programming",
  "unit1_lesson3_info": "1-2 min read · 0 questions",
  "unit1_lesson3_paragraph1": "In the previous lesson, it was mentioned that coding involves instructing the computer in how to solve a problem. But how exactly does the coder tell the computer what to do?  ",
  "unit1_lesson3_paragraph2": "When a coder begins their process, they first have to choose the right language to write the code in. Just as there are different languages in the world — like English, Spanish, and Korean — there are different languages in coding. (You’ll learn more about them when you reach the next station.)",
  "unit1_lesson3_paragraph3": "After they choose a language, they begin translating the solution so that computers can understand. During this process, they have to follow the syntax, or conventions, of the language, much like the ones that humans use.",
  "unit1_lesson3_paragraph4": "Coding is just one part of a bigger idea called programming, where plans are implemented and ideas and designs are turned into actual code. In the next lesson, you’ll learn about the other parts that complete the process of programming!",

  "unit1_lesson4_title": "4. The Programmer’s Workflow",
  "unit1_lesson4_info": "2-3 min read · 2 questions",
  "unit1_lesson4_paragraph1": "In the past two lessons, programming has been emphasized as the broader concept, and you might wonder what else there is to programming if coding isn’t all of it.",
  "unit1_lesson4_paragraph2": "Programming consists of four steps: planning, coding, testing, and debugging.",
  "unit1_lesson4_paragraph3": "Now, you might be picturing the process as something like this:",
  "unit1_lesson4_paragraph4": "In reality, programming is an iterative process, meaning that there isn’t a clear end to it. There are always points for improvement, and the product must constantly be adapted. The process, therefore, can be expressed as something more like this:",
  "unit1_lesson4_paragraph5": "During the “planning” stage of programming, developers create diagrams to visualize their thought process. One way to do this is through a flow chart. In this chart, each action item is connected to each other in an array of choices, and the viewer can follow along the program’s flow by starting from the top.",
  "unit1_lesson4_paragraph6": "During the “coding” stage of programming, developers use the programming language, or type of programming, best suited for the task to simulate the process in the flow chart. This stage often requires a lot of deep thought, as here is where the developer thinks of different logic and methods of creating the program.",
  "unit1_lesson4_paragraph7": "During the “testing” stage of programming, developers have people around them, or sometimes themselves, test out the program that they wrote. This can include intentionally making the program not work properly and trying out all sorts of scenarios to ensure that there are no problems in the future after the solution is published.",
  "unit1_lesson4_paragraph8": "During the “debugging” stage of programming, developers try to fix any problems that they found in the previous stage. Finding the problems in the code, or “bugs,” often takes a long time and is tedious.",
  "unit1_lesson4_question1": "QUESTION (T/F): Programming is a linear process.",
  "unit1_lesson4_question1_option1": "True",
  "unit1_lesson4_question1_option2": "False",
  "unit1_lesson4_question1_answer": "Good job!",
  "unit1_lesson4_question1_wrong_answer": "The correct answer is false! Programming happens in four stages that constantly repeat, making it a cyclic process.",
  "unit1_lesson4_question2": "QUESTION (A/B/C/D): What is the step that often takes the longest?",
  "unit1_lesson4_question2_option1": "A. Planning",
  "unit1_lesson4_question2_option2": "B. Coding",
  "unit1_lesson4_question2_option3": "C. Testing",
  "unit1_lesson4_question2_option4": "D. Debugging",
  "unit1_lesson4_question2_answer": "Awesome!",
  "unit1_lesson4_question2_wrong_answer": "Nice try! The correct answer is D. Debugging. The bigger the project gets, the longer it takes for someone to find a problem, or bug, in it.",

  "unit2_title": "UNIT 2: Programming languages",
  "unit2_lesson1_title": "1. What are Programming Languages?",
  "unit2_lesson1_info": "3-4 min read · 1 question",
  "unit2_lesson1_paragraph1": "When a coder begins to code, they first have to choose the right language to write the code in. Just as there are different languages in the world — like English, Spanish, and Korean — there are different languages in coding.",
  "unit2_lesson1_paragraph2": "Programming is often described as giving instructions to a computer for it to follow. Before giving these instructions, however, the language must be changed into something that both the computer and the human can understand, called 'code.'",
  "unit2_lesson1_paragraph3": "Programming languages can be considered a translator between human logic and machine instructions. For example, let's take a look at how a person can write code to make the computer say something in one of the most popular programming languages, Python.",
  "unit2_lesson1_paragraph4": "As you can see, the same instruction appears with some differences from human speech. Some of the most commonly used programming languages are Python, Java, and C/C++, which will be further introduced in the latter lessons of this unit.",
  "unit2_lesson1_paragraph5": "Programming languages aren't always so similar to human speech, though Python is simply one of the rare cases in which a programming language's syntax (grammar) is so similar to a human language's. This is because Python was developed in order to make coding more approachable to younger audiences.",
  "unit2_lesson1_paragraph6": "Below are some examples of programming languages that are not as reminiscent of human language.",
  "unit2_lesson1_paragraph7": "There are more than 2,000 programming languages in the world, but most of them are used for specific purposes. For instance, the languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are often used together to develop websites, and the language C# is mostly used for game development.",
  "unit2_lesson1_paragraph8": "Just like in real life, you don’t need to know and memorize every single programming language. However, once you learn and master one language, you will be able to learn more languages with relative ease, as all languages are based on similar concepts.",
  "unit2_lesson1_question1": "QUESTION (A/B/C/D): Which of these languages are mainly used for game development?",
  "unit2_lesson1_question1_option1": "A. CSS",
  "unit2_lesson1_question1_option2": "B. C#",
  "unit2_lesson1_question1_option3": "C. C++",
  "unit2_lesson1_question1_option4": "D. C",
  "unit2_lesson1_question1_answer": "Good!",
  "unit2_lesson1_question1_wrong_answer": "Close! The correct answer is B. C#. The other languages are existing languages, and each of them has a different purpose.",

  "unit2_lesson2_title": "2. Language Paradigms",
  "unit2_lesson2_info": "5 min read · 3 questions",
  "unit2_lesson2_paragraph1": "A paradigm is, according to Oxford Languages, a typical example or pattern of something. Although in programming there are many different language paradigms, the three major models to be covered in this lesson are imperative programming, functional programming, and object-oriented programming.",
  "unit2_lesson2_paragraph2": "Imperative programming is a type of programming that focuses on how a program operates. Instead of relying on models that solve the problem for you, imperative programming relies on simple, small, step-by-step logic. Some of the languages that use imperative programming include C and PHP. Commonly, imperative programming is used for short scripts or general-purpose development, as it is not suitable for larger-scale applications.",
  "unit2_lesson2_paragraph3": "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a type of programming that focuses on segmentation, which is where the name came from --- it’s oriented around blocks of code called “objects”. Some popular programming languages that use OOP include Java and Object Pascal. Often, it’s used for large-scale applications such as making mobile apps or game engines. Although this type of programming is initially complicated, it allows for easier reusability of code through OOP-specific features such as inheritance and polymorphism.",
  "unit2_lesson2_paragraph4": "Functional programming, just like its name, utilizes functions as the primary building blocks. Instead of focusing on the how, like imperative programming, it concentrates on the what. This type of programming is used in some of the more specific languages, such as Haskell and Scala. Instead of physical projects, functional programming is used in finance or science, as it is concise but better suited for managing data transformations.",
  "unit2_lesson2_paragraph5": "In this course, you will mostly be learning using Python, which is special in how it is a multi-paradigm language. ",
  "unit2_lesson2_question1": "QUESTION (A/B/C/D): How many major language paradigms will be covered in this lesson?",
  "unit2_lesson2_question1_option1": "A. 1",
  "unit2_lesson2_question1_option2": "B. 2",
  "unit2_lesson2_question1_option3": "C. 3",
  "unit2_lesson2_question1_option4": "D. 4",
  "unit2_lesson2_question1_answer": "Keep it up!",
  "unit2_lesson2_question1_wrong_answer": "It’s alright! The correct answer is C. 3.",
  "unit2_lesson2_question2": "QUESTION (A/B): What is the major difference between imperative and functional programming?",
  "unit2_lesson2_question2_option1": "A. Imperative programming focuses on the “how” of the problem, and functional programming focuses on the “what” of the problem.",
  "unit2_lesson2_question2_option2": "B. Imperative programming focuses on the “what” of the problem, and functional programming focuses on the “how” of the problem.",
  "unit2_lesson2_question2_answer": "Good job!!",
  "unit2_lesson2_question2_wrong_answer": "Confusing, right? The correct answer is A. Imperative programming focuses on the “how” of the problem, and functional programming focuses on the “what” of the problem.",

  "unit2_lesson3_title": "3. Syntax and semantics",
  "unit2_lesson3_info": "3 min read · 1 question",
  "unit2_lesson3_paragraph1": "If you’ve never studied logic or linguistics before, you’ve probably also never heard of the words “syntax” and “semantics” before. In simple terms, syntax is the “grammar” of code, and semantics is the “meaning” of code.",
  "unit2_lesson3_paragraph2": "Let’s dive deeper into each subtopic in more detail.",
  "unit2_lesson3_paragraph3": "The syntax, in programming, is the set of rules about how code must be written. Often, whatever platform you’re using to write code in (also called an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment) will remind you of the correct syntax.",
  "unit2_lesson3_paragraph4": "Let’s say that you were writing an instruction in English. You want to tell your friend to define a variable, x, and set its initial value to 1. In words, you might say, “Make a variable x and give it a value of 1.”",
  "unit2_lesson3_paragraph5": "In C++ code, you would write it as int x = 1; There, “int” sets the data type of the variable as an integer, “x” creates the name of the variable, “=” defines the variable, “1” is assigned to the variable, and “;” ends the line of code.",
  "unit2_lesson3_paragraph6": "Demonstrated above is the syntax for a simple variable definition. As you can see, once broken down, a line of code is not very different from a sentence. Semantics are the meanings of the code you wrote. A code may be syntactically correct, but if the semantics are not correct, it will have a different action than intended when it’s run. In short, syntax is the valid format of the code, and semantics is what the code actually does when it runs.",
  "unit2_lesson3_paragraph7": "Moving forward, remember that a good code has both correct syntax and correct semantics!",
  "unit2_lesson3_question1": "QUESTION (T/F): Syntax and semantics are like the alphabet and numbers of code.",
  "unit2_lesson3_question1_option1": "True",
  "unit2_lesson3_question1_option2": "False",
  "unit2_lesson3_question1_answer": "Exactly!",
  "unit2_lesson3_question1_wrong_answer": "Try again. The correct answer is True. There will be explanations below. Keep reading!",

  "unit2_lesson4_title": "Compilers vs. Interpreters",
  "unit2_lesson4_info": "2-3 min read · 1 question",
  "unit2_lesson4_paragraph1": "As you know by now, computers can’t understand human language, like English. They only understand machine languages, like the series of 0s and 1s that you’ve probably seen in movies.",
  "unit2_lesson4_paragraph2": "This sort of language is complicated and unreadable by humans. Therefore, programmers use programming languages, like C and Java, that are easier to understand by us. But because computers can’t understand this programming language, they go through a certain process that differs between compilers and interpreters.",
  "unit2_lesson4_paragraph3": "Let’s take a look at the differences between the two through an analogy.",
  "unit2_lesson4_paragraph4": "Imagine that there are two chefs, A and B. Chef A, when given a recipe for baking a cake, reads through the entire text before getting to work. They prepare all of the ingredients and materials and go through the process of baking the cake all at once. If there are mistakes in the recipe, Chef A will notice them before baking and won’t proceed until it’s fixed. Chef B, on the other hand, reads the recipe one step at a time and follows it immediately. They read the step “preheat the oven”, do it, then read “crack the egg”, do it, and so on. They don’t look ahead, and if there’s a mistake in the recipe, they might only discover it when they reach that step.",
  "unit2_lesson4_paragraph5": "Think of the compiler as Chef A and the interpreter as Chef B. The compiler language prepares and completes everything ahead of time, checking for bugs and inconsistencies before running the code. The interpreter language works step-by-step, executing each line of code as it comes. It runs the code even if there are possible mistakes, and the code stops when it reaches a bug. In the case of compilers, the code doesn’t run at all.",
  "unit2_lesson4_question1": "QUESTION (A/B): Make a guess; Which chef is the compiler?",
  "unit2_lesson4_question1_option1": "A. Chef A",
  "unit2_lesson4_question1_option2": "B. Chef B",
  "unit2_lesson4_question1_answer": "Nice job!",

  "unit2_lesson5_title": "Introduction to Python, Java, and C",
  "unit2_lesson5_info": "3 min read · 0 questions",
  "unit2_lesson5_paragraph1": "Python is a widely used programming language that was designed and developed in February 1991 by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch software engineer.",
  "unit2_lesson5_paragraph2": "Unlike other existing languages at the time, Python simplified the normally complex code into a readable syntax, reducing complexity and making it an optimal choice for novice programmers to study and use. Many syntactic difficulties are reduced, and it includes many built-in modules. To illustrate concepts in the future, NextStop will use Python code. ",
  "unit2_lesson5_paragraph3": "Due to its simplicity and applicability, it can be used for many purposes, such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more.",
  "unit2_lesson5_paragraph4": "Java is another widely used programming language that was designed and developed in May 1995 by Oracle Corporation and James Gosling, a Canadian computer scientist. ",
  "unit2_lesson5_paragraph5": "Java is an object-oriented programming paradigm, and is widely used in the technology industry in enterprise environments, backend development, and Android app development. It has an extensive set of built-in APIs and classes that assist any sort of concurrent programming.",
  "unit2_lesson5_paragraph6": "However, Java has a relatively complicated structure and organization, making the learning curve for it steep.",
  "unit2_lesson5_paragraph7": "C is also a widely used programming language that was designed and developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie, an American computer scientist.",
  "unit2_lesson5_paragraph8": "C is a low-level programming language, meaning that it provides access to the computer’s hardware and memory. It is comparatively efficient and is the foundation of many modern computer languages like Java and Python. C is mostly used for developing operating systems and has a minimal runtime.",
  "unit2_lesson5_paragraph9": "Even more so than Java, C has a steep learning curve, as its power and efficiency comes with a significant complexity that calls for many prerequisites.",

  "unit2_lesson6_title": "6. Domain-Specific Languages",
  "unit2_lesson6_info": "2 min read · 0 questions",
  "unit2_lesson6_paragraph1": "The concept of domain-specific languages (DSLs), or programming languages that exist for a specific purpose, was mentioned earlier in the lessons. Although many programming languages are adaptable and can be used for many different purposes, some languages are specialized for certain fields and functions.",
  "unit2_lesson6_paragraph2": "You can think of DSLs as college professors or secondary school subject-specific teachers, who specialize in their most skilled subject and teach it to students, and you can think of other languages as primary school homeroom teachers, who are able to teach a little bit of every subject.",
  "unit2_lesson6_paragraph3": "You’ve heard that multipurpose languages that are efficient in any purpose, such as Python, exist. Now, you might be wondering why DSLs exist. With languages that have a high domain specificity, there is an increased clarity and readability of the code, as it is developed specifically for that purpose and has existing functions to cater to the precise needs of that particular domain. There is also an improved efficiency, as these languages often eliminate the need to write boilerplate, or initializing, code.",
  "unit2_lesson6_paragraph4": "Some famous examples of DSLs are SQL, which is a language designed specifically for database data retrieval and querying, CSS, which is a language designed specifically for styling web pages, and XML, which is used specifically for data representation and exchange."
